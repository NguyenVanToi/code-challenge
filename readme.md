# Frontend Assessments

## About The Project

This repository contains my solutions for a frontend coding challenge. The assessment is divided into three separate problems, each designed to test different aspects of frontend engineering, including JavaScript/TypeScript, UI/UX, code review, and best practices.

## Reviewer Instructions

- Please read the README in each problem folder before reviewing the code for that problem.
- Inline comments and tags are provided in the code to clarify design decisions and highlight improvements.

Thank you for your time and consideration!
